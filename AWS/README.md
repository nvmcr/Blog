## Intro
The key concept of Amazon Web Services (AWS) is that *only pay for what is used*. The best thing about cloud when compared to on-premises data centers is to get as many resources as needed at any time and no need to get rid of them when not needed, that way one will pay only for what one used.
### Client-Server Model
A client can be a web browser or an application that a customer interacts to make requests to computer servers(Think as an analogy of a customer at a barista ordering a coffee). One such type of virtual server is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2).
### Cloud Computing
The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Types of clud computing include: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS).
* IaaS is a cloud computing model that provides customers with access to virtualized computing resources, such as servers, storage, and networking. With IaaS, the customer is responsible for managing the operating system, middleware, and applications. Examples of IaaS providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.
* PaaS is a cloud computing model that provides customers with a platform on which they can develop, run, and manage their own applications. With PaaS, the customer is responsible for developing and managing their applications, while the provider takes care of the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and networking. Examples of PaaS providers include Heroku, Google App Engine, and Microsoft Azure.
* SaaS is a cloud computing model that provides customers with access to software applications that are hosted and managed by a third-party provider. With SaaS, the customer only needs to access the application through a web browser or mobile app, and the provider is responsible for managing the infrastructure, middleware, and application. Examples of SaaS providers include Salesforce, Dropbox, and Google Apps.
The amount of control the customer has decreases from IaaS to SaaS.
