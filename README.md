## Motivation
As someone who is learning data science, looking for jobs and a ghajini/brainfart, I found myself constantly looking for resources for quick revision. However, I often found that the explanations and resources available were way too much or overly complex or filled with technical jargon that made it difficult to understand the concepts. Also, I have a habit of taking notes and jotting down key concepts and ideas that I wanted to remember. Scribbling down on the paper helps me to reinforce my understandings. But like I said, I scribble in some cryptic alien language that even I find hard to understand at times.

TL;DR: I need to write things down to remember and need a not so detailed but a simple revision guide. This is why I decided to create this reference guide that simplifies the world of data science in a way that is easy to understand for me and hopefully to others too.
### Inspired From
I love Google Research's [Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook) and [Bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert) README markdowns. While they have a lot of content available, the material can be easily covered in a short amount of time. In general, Github README's are simple, clear, easy to update and maintain with a straight forward layout.
