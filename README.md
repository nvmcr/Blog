## Motivation
As someone learning data science and searching for jobs, I often find myself needing quick revision resources. However, I struggle with the complexity and excessive technical jargon of many available explanations and resources. To reinforce my understanding, I have a habit of taking notes, but sometimes my scribbles end up in a cryptic alien language that even I struggle to decipher.

In short, I need a simple and concise revision guide that allows me to write things down for better retention. This is why I decided to create a reference guide that simplifies the world of data science, making it easily understandable for myself and hopefully for others as well.
### Inspired From
I love Google Research's [Tuning Playbook](https://github.com/google-research/tuning_playbook) and [Bert](https://github.com/google-research/bert) README markdowns. While they have a lot of content available, the material can be easily covered in a short amount of time. In general, Github README's are simple, clear, easy to update and maintain with a straight forward layout.
