# SQL
## Intro
Structured Query Language (SQL) is a language designed for users to query, manipulate and transform data from a relational database. Biggest advantage of SQL is that it is efficient and scalable for large and complex databases. Popular SQL databases include: SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. 
* What is a relational database? 
> A realtional database represents a collection of tables. For example, an university realtional database might have a table with `StudentId`, `Name`, `YearofPassing`, `GPA` and many other columns. There can be many other *related* tabes in that database. 
## SELECT Queries
`SELECT` statements are used to retrieve data from a SQL database. These statements are often refered as *queries*.
> A query is just a statement that tells the database what we want. It could be to retrieve, update or modify the data.
Queries have syntax. Say, there is a table named `table1` which has details of students. To retrieve specific columns the qury will look like:
```
SELECT name, gpa
FROM table1
```
If we need to see the entire table, asterisk (* ) can be used.
```
SELECT *
FROM table1
```
