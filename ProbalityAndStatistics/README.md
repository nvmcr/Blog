## Note
Ability to think probabilistically is important to data scientists. But only few basic concepts are enough for interviews and these concepts will go in depth in the statistics. So the meat of the concepts are in statistics.
# Probaility
## Basics
### Conditional Probability
One of the most asked questions are based on this. For example: What is the proability of a patient having a disease, given that the patient tested positive for the disease ? The questions generally asks What is the probaility of an event A given that an event B has occurred? 
$$ P(A|B) = {P(B|A)P(A)}\\over P(B) $$
