## Introduction
### What is Machine Learning
Fancy way
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
—Tom Mitchell, 1997

I would say its just making a machine learn using data.
### Types of Machine Learning
#### Based on human supervision
1. Supervised Learning 
If the training data has labels, it is supervised.
2. Unsupervised Learning 
Machine trained without labelled data.
3. Semisupervised Learning 
Only a few samples of the data is labelled. The machine learns to label the unlabelled samples. Example is a photo-hosting service like Google Photos.  Once
you upload all your family photos to the service, it automatically recognizes that the
same person A shows up in photos 1, 5, and 11, while another person B shows up in
photos 2, 5, and 7. This is the unsupervised part of the algorithm (clustering). Now all
the system needs is for you to tell it who these people are. Just one label per person,4
and it is able to name everyone in every photo, which is useful for searching photos1^(1).
