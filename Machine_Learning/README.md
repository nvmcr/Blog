There will be a lot of content in this markdown file. Please use the github's interactive navigation. (Too lazy to write/generate TOC)

## Introduction
### What is Machine Learning
Fancy way
> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. 
—Tom Mitchell, 1997

I would say its just making a machine learn using data.
